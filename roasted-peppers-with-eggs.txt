INGREDIENTS

2 large red peppers
1/3 cup shredded Havarti cheese
2 green onions thinly sliced (white and green parts separated)
4 eggs
pinch each salt and pepper

METHOD

Leaving stems intact, halve and core red peppers. Arrange, cut sides down, on foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake in 425?F (220?C) oven just until beginning to soften, about 10 minutes. 

Turn red peppers cut sides up; sprinkle with one-quarter of the Havarti and the white parts of green onions. Crack 1 egg into each red pepper half; sprinkle with salt and pepper. 

Bake in 425?F (220?C) oven until egg whites are just set yet yolks are still runny, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining Havarti and green parts of green onions. Broil until cheese is melted, about 1 minute.
